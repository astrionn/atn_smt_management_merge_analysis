10 i dont see an image
11 collapse side bar indicator missing / or MouseOver Event ?
11 sidebar changes see 6
11 padding for title smaller to maximize table space
11 missing way to add carrier, upload articles, upload carriers
11 padding left to table smaller to maximize table space 
11 indicators at the table column headers for sorting/filtering missing
11 searchbar should display its modified function "select anything"
11 vertical lines within table to seperate columns visibly missing
11 subtle alternating color in the table to seperate lines visibly missing
11 table columns should be reorderable and resizeable
12 placeholder for "no data" and "loading"
12 see 11
13 text should be modified to indicate either article or carrier file uplaod and allowed filetype is csv
14 only 1 file at a time per upload
14 nice upload animation I like it
15 can't see a difference to 14, only the footer button placement
16 validate article number field has to be unique
16 provider and manufacturer fields have auto comnplete suggestions
16 color should match rest of the desgign
17 I like this error indiction best, see 16
17 Article number is not unique error message
18 see 17,16
19 see 16,17
19 success indicator only on article number not on description, should indicate uniqueness
20 color should match rest of the design
21 see 11
21 static vertical sidebar order of icons, indicate current page only by highlight not reordering
22 see 11,21, collapse side bar indicator missing / or MouseOver Event ?
22 see 21
23 collapse diebar indicator missing / or MouseOver Event ?
23 lesspadding in title and main content
23 one storage always has to be selected (dot over the image of a shelf),its the default storage/ storage that the add action from the input on the right will be perfomed on
24 The table should be in a container that visibly indicates the relationship to the storage, 23 is hinting this behaviour
24 The button would only have adding carrier functionality, as articles are on the carriers.
24 less padding to maximize table space
24 the search bar should indicate modified functionality, see 11
24 no print icon but a lightbulb or lamp or other icon indicating, that the LEDs of the current selection of this tables will be turned on for a certain amount of time
25 more fields needed, article fields: [name,provider,manufacturer,description,sap_number] should be grouped, non editable and grayed out. additional carrier fields:[uid,diameter,width,container_type,quantity original, quantity_current,lot_number,reserved,delivered] all of these should be editable except quantity original. uid with uniques check, diameter,width,container_tyoe drop down with options, quanitty current and lot number int values, lot_number unique check, reserved and delivered are bool, so dropdown or toggle
25 color theme should match rest of the design
26 see 25
27 collapse diebar indicator missing / or MouseOver Event ?
27 less padding to maximize table spavce
27 How can the user display detailed information about a job that is not in the table ? This detailed information is the article-count list or  the carrier-count list after pre-setup or the carrier-couunt-actual_usage-note list after finishing the job..
27 How can the user further the state of a newly created job, i.e. get to pre-setup / prepare material ?
27 Only 1 row of the table should be selectable at a given time
27 Either collect or finish the currently selected job table header button is missing. I propose a checkmark for finishing job and replacing the arrow icon to the storage icon from the sidebar so it is not the same as on the material entry page to avoid confusion(same icon different effect). This icon should also be placed on the material storage page, by the collect input und collect job dropdown.
28 color theme should match rest of design
28 fields for job are [name,description,board,count,project,customer,project,machine,start_at,finsih_at]
28 in the table, in the article column "Machine name" makes no sens
28 board,project,customer should've drop downs with a create new options
29 see 28
29 left error message should state job name required or job name not unique
29 right error message should state description required
30 see 28
30 green outline only neccessary for jobname to indicate uniqueness
31 see 28
32 see 31
33 time picker missing

34 the timeline should contain rows, each rows representing one machine, datetime going from left to right, colored are the jobnames, below the start end end times
35 collapse side bar indicator missing / or MouseOver Event ?

38 see 37

39 see 36,37
