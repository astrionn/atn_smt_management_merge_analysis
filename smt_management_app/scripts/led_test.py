Django script to test LED functionality across all storage systems.
Usage: python manage.py runscript led_tests

This script will:
1. Find all storage systems
2. Light up each slot one by one
3. Cycle through colors: red, green, blue, yellow
4. Include delays between each slot
5. KEEP LEDs ON after script completion
